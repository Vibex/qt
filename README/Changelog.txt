Version 0.7.1		09/2/2013
	*Added transparency options back in the config file (I didn't mean to remove them).
	*Small changes to improve the taskbar.
	*Added the ability to hide the borders between windows by making them overlap (doesn't look good on default windows. Use a custom VS or windows classic).


Version 0.7.0		08/28/2013
	*Removed the icons. If I end up getting aroung to implementing them to the bar I will add them back.

	*Added direct shortcuts to workspaces via Win + #.
	*Can bind the mouse to a window with Win + Scrolllock.
	*Redid the way the config files are setup. It is far more efficient and cleaner then before. All the files were condensed into one. This will make it easier for me to write a GUI based setup program in the future.

Version 0.6.1		07/29/2013
	*Made it easier to add new hotkey layouts by seperating them into their own .ahk file. The current one that I have provided doesn't really work because it interfears with Win + L. In the future I will make better layouts (or you can make your own!).
	*Minor bug fixes and stuff.


Version 0.6.0		07/29/2013
	*Removed the option to switch monitor locations becausee it did nothing as of the last update (It was fixed by automatic monitor detection).

Version 0.5.0		07/23/2013
	*Finally finished the taskbar. I redid it from scratch and went for a more minimal but also more useful aproach. It's still a work in progress.
