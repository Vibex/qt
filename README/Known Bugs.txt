***BUGS***
Currently sometimes when hiding the titlebar on a window a black bar will appear at the bottom of the window. A fix for this can be activated in the configAdvanced.txt file.
The taskbar will flicker repeatedly when displaying non english characters.
For some reason when using the transparency scroll, the first time you scroll in a while, the window will instantly go 100% transparent. No idea why this is hapening, I'm currently looking into it.
