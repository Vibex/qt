BUGS
	*Currently sometimes when hiding the titlebar on a window a black bar will appear at the bottom of the window. Fixes for this can be activated in the configAdvanced.txt file.
	*For some reason when using the transparency scroll, the first time you scroll in a while, the window will instantly go 100% transparent. No idea why this is hapening.
	*If you have Adobe Flash Open the taskbar will not change the title on the bar. I think this is because it doesn't like losing focus so it tricks windows into thinking it's still active.
	*If you're using qt.pi on a non bbLean system, you will have major problems with explorer. This is an easy thing for me to fix, I just haven't had access to a PC with explorer in a little bit.
