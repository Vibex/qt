***BUGS***
Currently sometimes when hiding the titlebar on a window a black bar will appear at the bottom of the window. A fix for this can be activated in the configAdvanced.txt file.
The taskbar will flicker repeatedly when displaying non english characters.
When reloading the script with the Ctrl + Alt + R hotkey some settings can be accidentally broken. It is advised to just relaunch the script.
