*Adding a taskbar. This is now a valiable for beta testing. Still very much in development.
*Adding a setup app to customize options rather than/as well as a the .txt file. Still in concept.
*The auto moving of windows when changing the size of windows with the arrow keys. About 5% complete. Not avaliably for testing yet.
