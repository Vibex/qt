* Exclusion classes. List the classes below and seperate them with a ",". The classes of windows will be ignored when minimizing all windows and when the script is killed. These should be windows that should always stay the way they are. The classes below are important when using a UI other then qt.pi as your default.

* Set the value of how often the script will sleep for 10ms. A value of 10(ms) will keep the CPU usage lower than 50% on most systems. If you leave off the "ms" ending it will specify a number of lines instead of milliseconds. You can also specify unlimited speed (no delay) with the string "WARP DRIVE".
10ms

* Set the value of how long of a delay there is when using window commands (in ms, though the "ms" ending is not needed). This can cause problems if you lower the delay to far. You can also specify unlimited speed (no delay) with the string "WARP DRIVE".
100

* Set the value of how long of a delay there is when pressing keys (in ms, thotugh the "ms" ending is not needed). You can also specify unlimited speed (no delay) with the string "WARP DRIVE".

* Set this to 1 or 2 if you encounter a black bar beneath your windows when removing the titlebar. 1 will cause a small shift on the right border of the window (this method occasionally fails, but works most of the time). 2 will cause the window to disappear and then reappear to fix the bug (this method never fails, but is more noticeable and a little obnoxious). If you don't experience the bug set the value to 0.
