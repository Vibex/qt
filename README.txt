	qt.pi is a script that is based on a 3 x 3 grid of windows. It is a very flexible script used for WM. It is very intuitive as each placement on the numpad is in relation to its position on the monitor. It supports up to 3 monitors placed side by side and supports both vertical and horizontal monitors. This script is still in development, so if you come across any bugs please let me know.
