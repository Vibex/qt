	qt.pi is a script that is based on a 3 x 3 grid of windows. It is a very flexible script used for WM. It is very intuitive as each placement on the numpad is in relation to its position on the monitor. It supports up to 3 monitors placed side by side and supports both vertical and horizontal monitors. This script is still in development, so if you come across any bugs please let me know.

	The .exe version of the script will run off of the default settings. This will probably have to be editied slightly to suit your specific needs. The Source is based of of my own personal needs and is what I use. You will have to either heavily modify my script or copy the defaults into the proper folder if you wish to use the source.
	
	If you need any help you can read the .txt files in README folder or launch README.exe. You can also launch README.exe at any time by pressing Win + F1.
